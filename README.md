Gruvdisc
========
BetterDiscord theme based on the famous Gruvbox theme for Vim.

## Installation
First of all, you should have BetterDiscord up and running. You can install that here: 

* [BetterDiscord Installation guide](https://docs.betterdiscord.app/users/getting-started/installation)

After this, you can install the theme:

* [Gruvdisc Theme](https://github.com/WMagueta/Gruvdisc/blob/main/Gruvdisc.css)

Just click "Download Raw File", and choose the desired location.

Now, put the recently installed `Gruvdisc.css` in your `BetterDiscord/themes` folder.

That's it! The only step left is opening Discord and enabling the theme.
